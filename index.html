            <p>
                Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns,<br>
                driven time and again off course, once he had plundered<br>
                the hallowed heights of Troy.<br><br>
                
                Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds,<br>
                many pains he suffered, heartsick on the open sea,<br>
                fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home.<br>
                But he could not save them from disaster, hard as he strove—<br>
                the recklessness of their own ways destroyed them all,<br>
                the blind fools, they devoured the cattle of the Sun<br>
                and the Sungod wiped from sight the day of their return.<br><br>
                
                Launch out on his story, Muse, daughter of Zeus,<br>
                start from where you will—sing for our time too.<br>
